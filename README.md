# Bookings for Craft CMS

An advanced booking plugin for [Craft CMS](https://craftcms.com) and [Craft Commerce](https://craftcommerce.com).

**Warning:** This plugin is a _work in progress_ and therefore _should not be used in a production environment_ (or any environment for that matter).

This fork re-works the Availability logic to return details on all the slots defined by the base rule and the exception rules. This better suits our use case.

## Requirements

This plugin requires Craft CMS 3.0.0-rc17 or later.

## Installation

To install the plugin, follow these instructions.

1. Open your terminal and go to your Craft project:

        cd /path/to/project

2. Then tell Composer to load the plugin:

        composer require ether/bookings

3. In the Control Panel, go to Settings → Plugins and click the “Install” button for Bookings.
